# Updating README.md for public repository status (2025-09-03 05:21Z)

_**User (2025-09-07 09:08Z)**_

create one .gitignore, LICENSE file, update the README.md file as I am willing to make the github repository public, remove the .specstory folder as well, as it's irrelevant.

The `.gitignore` and `LICENSE` files have been created. The `` folder contents have been deleted, and the folder is now empty. 

Next, I'll update your `README.md` to reflect that the repository is public and add a section about licensing and contribution. Would you like a standard public repository welcome, or do you have specific details you'd like included?
