# 🤖 Windows MCP Automation Chatbot

## 📁 File Structure
Create this folder structure on your desktop:

```
windows-mcp-chatbot/
├── server.js              ← Copy from "server.js" artifact
├── package.json           ← Copy from "package.json" artifact  
├── public/
│   └── index.html         ← Copy from "index.html" artifact
└── README.md              ← This file
```

## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create Project Folder
- Create folder: `C:\Users\[YourName]\Desktop\windows-mcp-chatbot`
- Create subfolder: `public`

### 2. Copy Files
- Copy **package.json** artifact content → save as `package.json`
- Copy **server.js** artifact content → save as `server.js` 
- Copy **index.html** artifact content → save as `public/index.html`

### 3. Install Node.js
- Download from: https://nodejs.org
- Install the **LTS version** (recommended)
- Restart your terminal after installation

### 4. Install Dependencies
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in project folder:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\[YourName]\Desktop\windows-mcp-chatbot"
npm install
```

### 5. Start Server
```bash
node server.js
```

You should see:
```
🚀 MCP Bridge Server running on http://localhost:3001
📡 Ready to process Windows automation requests
🔧 MCP integration: SIMULATION MODE
```

### 6. Test the Chatbot
- Open browser: http://localhost:3001
- Try the quick action buttons or type messages like:
  - "Take a screenshot"
  - "Open calculator" 
  - "Show system info"
  - "Test connection"

## ✅ What Works Right Now

### Current Features:
- ✅ Beautiful chat interface
- ✅ Auto-suggestions for common tasks
- ✅ Simulated responses for all Windows commands
- ✅ Real-time message processing
- ✅ Error handling and connection status
- ✅ Professional UI with animations

### Simulated Commands:
- 📸 **Screenshots**: "Take a screenshot"
- 🚀 **App Launching**: "Open calculator", "Launch notepad"
- 💻 **System Info**: "Show system info", "Computer specs"
- 💾 **Disk Space**: "Check disk space", "Show storage"
- 📱 **Running Apps**: "List running apps", "What's open"
- 🔌 **Connection Test**: "Test connection"

## 🔄 Next Steps (Real MCP Integration)

Once the basic version is working, we can:

1. **Connect Real MCP**: Replace simulation with actual MCP Windows agent calls
2. **Add More Features**: File operations, system monitoring, etc.
3. **Enhance UI**: Voice input, file uploads, drag & drop
4. **Deploy**: Make accessible from other devices

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "node is not recognized"
- Install Node.js from nodejs.org
- Restart terminal/command prompt
- Try: `node --version`

### "Cannot connect to server" 
- Make sure server is running: `node server.js`
- Check if port 3001 is free
- Visit: http://localhost:3001/api/health

### Files not found
- Double-check file locations and names
- Ensure `index.html` is in the `public/` folder
- Verify `server.js` and `package.json` are in root folder
